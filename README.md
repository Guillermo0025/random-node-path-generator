# random-node-path-generator

using the Delaunay library, matplotlib.pyplot and the numpy library with those libraries we will be randomly generating a graph 
using some functions within these libraries. Starting from this graph, we will be generating random paths and we will be getting the total 
path cost and we will be showing the graph and the followed path graphically.
